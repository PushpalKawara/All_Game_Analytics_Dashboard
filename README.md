## 📌 Overview

Welcome to the **Game Analytics Dashboard**, a smart and simple visual tool that breaks down player activity across game levels — especially focusing on **where players quit (drop-off)** and **where they return (retention)**.

📈 This dashboard reads Excel game logs and provides crystal-clear analytics for:

- 📉 Drop rate trends across levels
- 🔁 Retention curve visualization
- 🎯 Player engagement patterns

> This tool was crafted as a **personal project** and learning experience based on real-world scenarios — **no company data or assets are used here.**

## 🧠 Why I Built This

While interning as a **Game Analyst**, I faced repetitive tasks like:

- Manual drop rate calculations
- Hunting for retention issues across levels
- Presenting insights quickly to stakeholders

This project is a personal take on **automating** those steps and **visualizing** insights in a single dashboard.

> ⚠️ *Note: No company files, formulas, or formats have been used. This project is inspired by the concept only.*
